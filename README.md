# node-murmurhash

**NOTE:** This is a port of [Gary Court's excellent work](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js), to a commonJS module that can be easily included into a node.js project or the browser. I take no credit for the implementation. I am simply making it easier to use for others.

An optimized JavaScript implementation of the MurmurHash algorithms.

These algorithms take a JavaScript string (and a seed), and quickly create a non-cryptographic 32-bit hash from it. And by quick I mean sub-millisecond performance.

More information about these algorithms can be found at:

* [MurmurHash Homepage](http://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/)
* [Wikipedia Entry on MurmurHash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash)

## Installation

Install it in your browser:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="murmurhash.js"></script>
```

or in node.js

```
npm install murmurhash
```

```js
murmurhash = require('murmurhash')
```

Both version 2 and 3 of the MurmurHash algorithm are supported:

```js
// generates a v2 hash
murmurhash.v2("some input")

// generates a v3 hash
murmurhash.v3("some input")
```
